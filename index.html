            <h2>About Organic Farming</h2>
            <p>Organic farming promotes sustainable practices, avoiding synthetic chemicals and focusing on natural methods to enhance soil fertility and crop health. It emphasizes soil and water conservation, biodiversity, and ecological balance.</p>
            <p>Key practices in organic farming include crop rotation, composting, biological pest control, and the use of organic fertilizers. By adopting organic farming methods, farmers contribute to healthier ecosystems and produce nutritious, chemical-free food.</p>
            <p>Organic farming also supports local economies and communities, providing consumers with transparent and ethical food choices.</p>
            <p>In recent years, organic farming has gained popularity due to increasing awareness about environmental sustainability and health concerns associated with conventional farming practices. Consumers are increasingly choosing organic products for their health benefits and to support sustainable agriculture.</p>
